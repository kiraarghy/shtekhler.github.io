        I am a 25 year old front-end programmer from London, UK. I tweet from <a target="_blank" class='link' href="https://twitter.com/KiraArghy">@KiraArghy</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My programming journey began with Bioinformatics and Statistical Modelling using various Python and Perl tools. Due to interests and
        career, this programming took the back-seat for the next 2 years before rediscovering my passion by producing a training
        program through
        <a target="_blank" class='link' href="https://github.com/shtekhler/STEES">Twine</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since April 2017 I have been working on projects and learning through the excellent coaches at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://codebar.io/">CodeBar</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Primarily I use the React library, I have experience of <a target="_blank" class='link' href="https://github.com/shtekhler/SnappenChoot">React Native</a>,
        Thunk, <a target="_blank" class='link' href="https://github.com/shtekhler/ReduxTodo_List">Redux</a> and various other libraries and
        <a target="_blank" class='link' href="https://github.com/shtekhler/express-workshop">frameworks</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy learning new things, recently beginning <a target="_blank" class='link' href="https://t.co/3a50sNt0op">WebVr</a>        development, as well as some new libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I am a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/">QueerCode London</a> organiser and
        hope to start coaching at CodeBar in the near future.
